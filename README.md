# BasicPassEncrypt
An extremely basic password encryption method.
This will encrypt the password of your choosing to eight characters more than what is entered. 
For example if the password is "ABC123" the encrypted password will be "IJK9:;"

A scanner can be implemented to create a password that isn't hard coded. 

You can tweak code to make the basic encryption slightly more complex by changing the key.

THIS IS AN EXTREMELY BASIC ENCRYPTION FOR BEGINNERS LEARNING PURPOSES.
